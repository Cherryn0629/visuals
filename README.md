## Install dependencies

To build the visualization I used OpenCV 4.2.0 and Cinder 0.9.2. I added a script `setup.sh` that will install all of Cinder's dependencies and OpenCV. If you want to make sure to have all dependencies installed, run
```bash
./setup.sh
```


## Building the visualization

Build the repository in your favorite C++ IDE or run 
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
to build the visualization.
